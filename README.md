Perhaps this will help somebody get started with the SLIM PHP framework and rest api applications using sqlite as a light weight database rather than put a couple of records into a production database like MYSQL or POSTGRES.

Nobody is doing me any favours and perhaps they never will!

You may like to try and secure your update and delete routes as an excercise.

Good luck.
